# Python Watermarking Script

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Python script to automate the process of watermarking images. Uses rawpy and PIL (Python Imaging Library) to 
convert image file type and watermark.

- Recognises image orientation. 
- Drop images you're wanting to watermark into /images
- Run ```python watermark.py```

Built this as a quick little side project to help me speed up the work I do on the side for my girlfriend's
photography business. 

## Stack

- [rawpy] - for raw image file processing and conversion.
- [PIL] - Python Imaging Library, used for image processing.
